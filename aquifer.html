The area of Oldsmar that I live in is currently being developed by Ryland Homes, and the community is<a href="http://oldsmarconnect.com/oldsmar-area-residents-riled-up-about-ryland-projects/"> angry</a>.
<br>
In response, I have co-written a conservationist horror movie, with the developer as the villain, and showcasing the natural beauty of the Mobbly Bayou. <br> <br>

SYNOPSIS:    A native Floridian returns home with her boyfriend to find a new housing development may be disrupting the original inhabitants of the land. When the earth opens up to reveal itâ€™s poisons the couple will do anything to get out.
<br>
<br>
Currently in pre-production.
