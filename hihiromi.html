A car passes in the distance, there is faint laughter. Likely girls her age, with wind in their dandelion hair, greeting the first days of summer break.  ')">

<p><i>I am currently working on:</i> a valentine inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILOVEYOU"target="_blank"> ILOVEYOU virus</a>, a short film for <a href="http://borsc.ht/fest/"target="_blank"> Borscht Diez</a>, and a novella about a girl named Cami who is trying to bring her dead mother back by building thousands of life simulations.</p>



<p><i>I am thinking about:</i> the dangers of letting algorithms curate your existence, perception altering information, politics as binary, and whether or not to adopt a greyhound.</p>
