Why are you reading this?
You could be doing so many things. 
Tying your shoe. 
Watching videos of baby elephants.
Staring at your hands.
Cleaning the blades of your fan (how do they get so dirty?!)
But
You are here.
So, welcome. 

have a good time!

think about:

THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: 
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, 
and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, 
which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" 
Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

or

how nice it is to kiss soft lips,

or

whether or not you are working on things that you believe are important.
