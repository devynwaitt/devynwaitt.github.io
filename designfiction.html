<div class="devyn2">Dream House</div> <br>

<p>Dream house is a virtual reality sandbox platform, a "virtual dollhouse" and social network that allows users to design a 3D virtual space.</p>

<p>It began as a critical design narrative device in The Beautiful Future, speaking to larger ideas about an increasingly simulated existence. In the series, the platform is "born from a tumblr and Pinterest merger after ownership of the VR headsets became ubiquitous," and the experience is highly addictive as users have access to virtual possessions they are unable to afford in real life. Our protagonist's mother slowly becomes addicted to the game, and throughout the story we see her real house fall into disrepair as she becomes a celebrity in the Dream House network. </p>

<p>Features include: social components (invite your friends to your house), allow for curators (tours and events in popular spaces), maker components (create your own design templates and objects for others to use). Minecraft meets Pinterest for the virtual age. </p>

<div class="mit-head3">Mind Chat</div>
<p>Mind Chat is a form of communication through an augmented reality wearable device. Your interface appears projected onto the real world. The technology is based loosely on the speculative designs of the Magic Leap. The device responds to small motor movements, head and facial gestures, as well as hand and finger movement. </p>

<p>In the series, MC takes the form of critical theory, as Ava who communicates solely through MC has difficulty vocalizing and maintaining eye contact. While her MC communication is rapid-fire and eloquent, her verbal abilities are stunted. </p>

<div class="mit-head3">Biometric Mood Rings</div>
<p>Something I find underrepresented in science fiction and speculative design, are some of the nuanced touches of femininity. So often we see the future painted as sleek, sterile, cold, and androgynous. By marrying the quantitative efficiency of monitoring biometric data, with the kitsch girliness of a mood ring, a transhuman object becomes relatable. </p>

<p>As a form of critical design, the ring works as a prescient data gathering device for advertisers. An example being the ring transmitting information about your dehydration to a refreshment company to advertise to you before you feel thirst.</p>

        <div class="mit-head3">Outsource</div>
      <p>Developed initially to work with MC devices and then as an intracranial software, outsource allows you to place thoughts into a separate brain bank, to be accessed later. The software then crawls the internet and creates a customizable brief which you can either read, or have loaded directly back into your cognition.  </p>

      <div class="mit-head3">No Nets</div>
      <p> No-nets exist in <i>The Beautiful Future</i> as a form of rebellion against nearly ubiquitous internet. It is my interest with this series, to create critical design in the form of cultural attitudes, as well as through technology and objects. The no-net is representative of what I envision will be a growing anti-technology movement. It is a remote area set up to have no wi-fi, satellites or cameras, and is frequented by anarchist kids with a desire to disconnect.   </p>
