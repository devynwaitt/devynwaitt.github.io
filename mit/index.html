  <div class="mit-head2">The Beautiful Future</div>
  <p>  The Beautiful Future is a science prediction narrative TV series about a young woman crippled by her mostly digital existence. She falls in love with an offline advocate and he incites an awakening in her, amidst a society battling between techno-optimism and a return to the organic. Comprised of eight scripted episodes, it covers topics like privacy, automation, brain-computer interfaces, digital citizenship, machine intelligence, and entropy.</p>

  <div class="mit-head3">Tone Clip</div>
  <p>A moving look book for the series, intended to establish the visual style and mood.</p>

  <p>It is my intention to use tropes, and classic storytelling with pop sensibility, to communicate critical theory and critical design to a mainstream audience. “A spoonful of sugar,” is the way I think about the commercial aspects of the series, and their role as a vehicle for grander ideas and criticisms about our relationship with technology.</p>

    <div class="mit-head3">Dream House</div> <br>

    <p>Dream house is a virtual reality sandbox platform, a "virtual dollhouse" and social network that allows users to design a 3D virtual space.</p>

    <p>It began as a critical design narrative device in The Beautiful Future, speaking to larger ideas about an increasingly simulated existence. In the series, the platform is "born from a tumblr and Pinterest merger after ownership of the VR headsets became ubiquitous," and the experience is highly addictive as users have access to virtual possessions they are unable to afford in real life. Our protagonist's mother slowly becomes addicted to the game, and throughout the story we see her real house fall into disrepair as she becomes a celebrity in the Dream House network. </p>

    <p>Features include: social components (invite your friends to your house), allow for curators (tours and events in popular spaces), maker components (create your own design templates and objects for others to use). Minecraft meets Pinterest for the virtual age. </p>

    <div class="mit-head3">Mind Chat</div>
    <p>Mind Chat is a form of communication through an augmented reality wearable device. Your interface appears projected onto the real world. The technology is based loosely on the speculative designs of the Magic Leap. The device responds to small motor movements, head and facial gestures, as well as hand and finger movement. </p>

    <p>In the series, MC takes the form of critical theory, as Ava who communicates solely through MC has difficulty vocalizing and maintaining eye contact. While her MC communication is rapid-fire and eloquent, her verbal abilities are stunted. </p>

  <div class="mit-head3">Biometric Mood Rings</div>
  <p>Something I find underrepresented in science fiction and speculative design, are some of the nuanced touches of femininity. So often we see the future painted as sleek, sterile, cold, and androgynous. By marrying the quantitative efficiency of monitoring biometric data, with the kitsch girliness of a mood ring, a transhuman object becomes relatable. </p>

  <p>As a form of critical design, the ring works as a prescient data gathering device for advertisers. An example being the ring transmitting information about your dehydration to a refreshment company to advertise to you before you feel thirst.</p>

            <div class="mit-head3">Outsource</div>
          <p>Developed initially to work with MC devices and then as an intracranial software, outsource allows you to place thoughts into a separate brain bank, to be accessed later. The software then crawls the internet and creates a customizable brief which you can either read, or have loaded directly back into your cognition.  </p>

          <div class="mit-head3">No Nets</div>
          <p> No-nets exist in <i>The Beautiful Future</i> as a form of rebellion against nearly ubiquitous internet. It is my interest with this series, to create critical design in the form of cultural attitudes, as well as through technology and objects. The no-net is representative of what I envision will be a growing anti-technology movement. It is a remote area set up to have no wi-fi, satellites or cameras, and is frequented by anarchist kids with a desire to disconnect.   </p>

    <div class="mit-head2">Watching Me</div>
    <p>I recorded my computer screen for one month, in an exploration of privacy. The objective was to see how I felt, and whether to not my behavior changed when I knew my digital actions were being recorded. Even though no one would watch without my consent, I observed the mere act of recording, without a viewer, created unease and self consciousness behind my actions. I was less likely to conduct ‘indulgent’ behavior, wasting time on social media or watching television shows; and visited sites and read articles in line with my professed interests. This project is part of an on-going study about the psychological effects of transparency. The video below is a compilation of the footage. </p>
    <p> I also published personal emails from one month, <a href="https://newhive.com/devyn/january-2012">here</a>. </p>

    <div class="mit-head2">Tropical Depression</div>
    <p> Proposal for a VR experience crafted at the request of the Tribeca Institute.</p>


    <p><i>Synopsis</i>: We meet Jasmine at a point in her life where she is confused about who she is, and where her life is going. The story takes place almost entirely in her mind, as she walks down a country road to the gas station. By skipping along her neural pathways, a picture of her current predicament comes into focus.  We discover a strained relationship with her new husband, romanticized versions of her past, and a desire to escape through visions of the future.</p>
    <center><img src="/mit/static/depression.png" width="800"></center>
    <p><i>Artist statement</i>: I have always been fascinated by the way my mind works, especially when writing. Something outside of my consciousness seems to bring related moments from my past to whatever I am currently trying to work through. Sometimes it is only after reading what I have written that I understand the ties. Thinking of this, which leads to that, sometimes bound by a color or feeling. Thinking about my parents breaking up, and remembering the red dress my mother wore sitting on the patio when she decided to leave; the same shade as a neon bar sign outside of my old apartment. It is this swift movement through thoughts and memories that I aim to explore on Jasmine’s walk to the gas station. What is the mechanism behind your mind? How much of the external world propels it’s motion?</p>

    <p>As opposed to presenting her struggle in a traditional narrative, it will be revealed through her thought patterns. The intimate nature of this approach calls to mind the William Blake quote, about infinity in a grain of sand. Or the Nicholson Baker novel, <i>The Mezzanine,</i> the entirety of which takes place on the protagonist’s journey up an escalator.By learning about Jasmine through her perception and linked memories, we go deeper than internal dialogue, nearly to the electricity traveling through her brain. Filming the sequences in 360 video, we enable a viewer to experience Jasmine’s environments, with her thoughts swirling through the air, as close to inside of her mind as technology currently allows.

    <p>A subtext of the film, will be the seamless integration and effect of social networking on her thoughts. The impulse to, after seeing a beautiful flower, share it online as opposed to admire it is second nature. By being inside of her thoughts, we have a firsthand look at how ‘share’ and ‘like’ culture interrupts and infiltrates them. We see Jasmine’s already fragmented mind, further scattered by maintaining several different online identities.</p>

    <p>Her musings on the fate of humanity’s relationship with technology serve as form of escape from her own problems. They also exist as a device, a liberating and immediate way to express my own concerns about issues like net neutrality and the existential risk of artificial intelligence. By turning them into the thoughts of a character, I can present them as what they actually are - ideas.The film climaxes with an imagined vision of herself as a goddess of liberty, in a world tattered and torn apart. The barriers of her mind breached, simulation exposed. We juxtapose this fearful fever pitch with a return to traditional narrative. No internal monologue, or wandering thoughts, a simple exchange with the man at the gas station. Showing how sometimes connection with a stranger, a human, is just what you need to get you out of your head.</p>

              <div class="mit-head2">Your Stance</div>


            <p>Your Stance is a social network designed for politics, a singular source on the internet to learn where people stand politically, and to craft your own political identity. </p>

            <p>I am the co-creator and UX designer of this endeavor, which is currently in a beta/testing phase, with plans to launch early in 2017.</p>

            <p><i>Objectives of the site:</i><br><br>
              - Users create sheets to show the world where they stand on the issues. These sheets become the ‘go to’ source to quickly learn a person’s world view. Imagine reading a controversial blog post on Medium and then immediately having access to the author’s world view. Would this change the way you read the article?<br><br>
              - Provides a unique way to assess political issues. Every topic will feature the top stances from each side, side by side. Users can then vote on their favorite stances, pushing the most popular stance to the top.  It is a battle of the best ideas. This in turn, makes the site the ‘go to’ source for getting the world’s best opinions on a given topic.<br><br>
              - Users can click on these stances to get into the debate section. The debate section takes your typical Facebook squabble and supercharges it. While debate on current social websites is nothing more than a back and forth on a single comment thread, Your Stance provides users a way to debate in a productive manner.  With a system we call “hyper-debate,” comprised of a voting and flagging algorithm, fact-checking and winners.<br><br>
              - As the site scales, the functionality will include an option to vote on bills currently being passed in Congress. Users can opt in to e-mail updates about these bills and share their stance. We will make this data public, and perhaps create representatives beholden to their constituents.</p>

      <div class="mit-head2">Aquaponic Spice Shelf!</div>
      <p>I made a wall mounted ‘Hanging Rose Garden’ based on this idle sketch.  Garden is a misnomer as it is just cut roses in glass vases. I am currently developing an actual wall mounted garden, in the form of an “Aquaponic Spice Shelf!”</p>

      <p>I have always wanted to have fresh spices on hand constantly, so have begun the process of prototyping a similar design in the form of an aquaponic spice garden. This is obviously not a technical drawing, but I am bringing it to life with the help of a botanist friend and the kind salespeople at Lowes.</p>
